# Phobia-Detector
We will be making a model, from which you can choose a video from your laptop. The model will be able to detect if there is any trigger with respect to phobias. The idea behind this application is that a lot of individuals can get triggered by videos that can cause panic attacks or anxiety. Therefore in order to prevent that, a model that will be trained on the different phobias so that it gives off a warning of potentially sensitive things present in the video.\
The phobias we are including are:\
\
| MODEL|ACCURACY|VALIDATION ACCURACY |\
|-----------|------|\
| Cat & Dog Model|85.9%|81.2%|\
| Horse & Human| 99.51%|74.22%|\
